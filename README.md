# airfoil-conformal-mapping
A Python tool for calculating airfoil lift using conformal mapping. It includes an optimization algorithm to find the circle parameters from airfoil data generated by the Joukowsky transform. The package also features an interactive GUI that lets users adjust the circle parameters and see the changes in real time.
